## Introduction

> Start with a broad picture of the importance and significance of your chosen field while explaining introductory concepts. State the problem and goals that your research will address. Please cite any referenced literature.

Genetic variation is the cornerstone of biological diversity and evolution, underlying the vast array of phenotypes observed within and across species. Understanding the mechanisms and consequences of genetic variation is crucial for unraveling the complexities of life, from individual health and disease susceptibility to the adaptability and survival of species in changing environments. We use some inspiration from [Thomas Hunt Morgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hunt_Morgan)[^no-relation], who was a pioneering American geneticist whose work with fruit flies ([Drosophila melanogaster]). Our paper aims to shed light on the phenotypic diversity in three different environments in and around a hypothetical high-school.

## Materials & Methods

> Describe how you performed your work, referencing methods and procedures of previous research conducted. Focus on the important aspects of your methods and avoid going into too much detail in describing commonly used methods.

In this investigation, we employed a comparative approach to study genetic variation within [Drosophila melanogaster] populations collected from distinct environments. The methodology is structured to facilitate reproducibility and educational engagement while adhering to the rigor of scientific inquiry. This study was conducted following ethical guidelines for the use of model organisms in educational settings, ensuring the humane treatment of [Drosophila melanogaster] throughout the project.

### Sample Collection

[Drosophila melanogaster] specimens were systematically collected from three distinct environments within the school's vicinity: the cafeteria, the biology laboratory, and outdoor green spaces. In @fig:samples, you can see a comically large fly entering the trap that we made. The collection was conducted using simple fruit bait traps over a period of one week to ensure a representative sample of the fly population in each area.

### Data Analysis

The observed phenotypic data were classified and recorded in a database. Frequencies of each trait within and across populations were calculated and analyzed to assess the level of genetic variation. Statistical analyses, including [chi-square tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_test), were employed to determine the significance of variation between populations, using Jupyter Notebooks an open-source platform that is suitable for educational purposes and advanced research.

### Phenotypic Variation Among Populations

Morphological examination of the fruit flies revealed distinct phenotypic variations, particularly in eye color and wing size, across the three sampled populations. The cafeteria population exhibited a higher frequency of red-eyed flies (76%) compared to the biology laboratory (58%) and outdoor green spaces (63%). Similarly, variations in wing size were observed, with larger wings being more prevalent in the outdoor population (68%) compared to the cafeteria (49%) and laboratory populations (53%) [See @tab:phenotypic-variation].

### Statistical Analysis of Phenotypic Differences

> Math can be included using the ` ```{math} ` directive with a label, and cross-referenced in the same way as figures.
> Math syntax is written in LaTeX, see the [math documentation](https://mystmd.org/guide/math).
> Inline math is surrounded by dollar-signs, for example, $\chi^2$.

Chi-square tests were conducted to evaluate the statistical significance of the observed differences in phenotypic traits between the fruit fly populations from different environments. We used the chi-squared formula @eq:chi-squared to do the analysis.

```{math}
:label: eq:chi-squared
\chi^2=\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}
```

The analysis for eye color variation yielded a chi-square statistic of 7.66 with a p-value of 0.022 ($\chi^2$ = 7.66, df = 2, p < 0.05), indicating statistically significant differences in eye color distribution across environments. This suggests that the variation in eye color among the populations could indeed be influenced by their respective environmental conditions.

Similarly, the analysis for wing size variation showed a chi-square statistic of 8.17 with a p-value of 0.017 ($\chi^2$ = 8.17, df = 2, p < 0.05). The differences in wing size across populations are also statistically significant. This finding suggests that, like eye color, the variation in wing size is likely influenced by environmental factors, rather than being a result of random variation.

> This ensures your research is reproducible.

The results prompt a discussion on the role of environmental factors in shaping genetic variation within populations, which can be seen in @fig:environment. The significant variation in eye color across populations suggests a potential adaptive response to different environmental conditions encountered in each habitat. The lack of significant difference in wing size may indicate that this trait is less sensitive to environmental variation or that the sample size and environmental differences were not sufficient to reveal a significant adaptive pattern.

## Conclusion

> Recap briefly what was learned from your research and assess the validity of your conclusions. Consider what questions might still remain to be answered and put them in terms of future work and how your research could act as a foundation in addressing these questions.

Our investigation into the phenotypic variations of [Drosophila melanogaster] across different environments has yielded insightful findings on the influence of environmental factors on genetic expression. Through the meticulous collection and analysis of data pertaining to eye color and wing size, we have observed significant variations that suggest a strong environmental component to genetic variation within these populations.

The statistical analysis, particularly the Chi-Squared tests, reinforced these observations by confirming the statistical significance of the differences in phenotypic traits across the environments studied. The findings indicate that the cafeteria, biology laboratory, and outdoor green spaces each present unique conditions that could influence the genetic expression of [Drosophila melanogaster], leading to observable differences in eye color and wing size.

This study contributes to the broader understanding of how environmental factors interact with genetic predispositions to shape the phenotypic outcomes of populations. It underscores the importance of considering both genetic and environmental variables in the study of biological diversity and evolution.

Furthermore, this research demonstrates the feasibility and educational value of conducting genuine scientific inquiries in a high school setting. By engaging students in hands-on research, we not only foster a deeper understanding of genetic principles but also cultivate critical thinking, data analysis skills, and an appreciation for the scientific method.

In conclusion, the observed phenotypic variations in [Drosophila melanogaster] across different environmental settings highlight the dynamic interplay between genetics and the environment. Future studies could expand upon this work by exploring additional environmental variables, employing genetic sequencing to pinpoint specific genetic changes, and incorporating larger sample sizes to enhance the robustness of the findings. Through continued research, we can further unravel the complex mechanisms of genetic variation and environmental adaptation, enriching our comprehension of the natural world.
